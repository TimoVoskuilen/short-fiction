      <span class="dropcap">T</span>he last time Mash-ragal saw the boots, his brother spoke his final goodbyes. In his memory, their fluorescent glow was brighter than that of his gloves.
      A set of family jewels -- once worn by the second great king of the isles of the forgotten souls -- so powerful, they could disrupt the equilibrium. <br>
      Mash-ragal, living at the border of the great isles, ruling over the barakas, servants, at heart. 
      The barakas are small, fragile creatures gifted with the hearing of thousand whispers. The Barakas have been picking rumours over the location of the boots.<br>

      A sense of emptieness, grief, anger, left Mash dire for the power the jewels would bring.
