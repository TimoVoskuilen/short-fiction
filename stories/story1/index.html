    <p>
      <span class="dropcap">T</span>he last time Mash-ragal saw the boots, his brother spoke his final goodbyes. 
      In his memory, their fluorescent glow was brighter than that of his gloves.
      A set of family jewels - once worn by the second king of the isles of the forgotten souls.
      When worn by a family master, the set remembered - and it never forgave. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Mash-Ragal, living at the border of the Great Isles - a place of quiet, where the only source of light,
      is that of his gloves.
      There he rules over the Barakas — servants at heart.
      They are small, fragile creatures, gifted with the hearing of a thousand whispers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since his brother left, the Isles have not been the same.
      A sense of emptiness, grief, and anger left Mash dire for the power the jewels would bring.
      The Barakas heard it first — faint, scattered through the wind.
      They whispered of a place long sealed beneath stone: the Pyramid of Thareen.
      The whispers grew bolder with each passing night, threading through dreams of his servants.
      By the third dawn, even Mash could hear them — calling his name.
      Mash rose from his throne and spoke only one word: “March.”

    </p>

    <p>
      When Mash and a thousand servants arrived at the pyramid, there was silence.
      They could peek through the holes of the massive gates.
      There they saw it — a faint green shimmer bleeding through the cracks of the great stone door.

      Mash raised his arms to the sky and began conjuring an almighty thunderstorm.
      Beams of light burst from his gloves, shooting into the heavens.
      The Barakas turned purple, and their eyes glowed deep red.
